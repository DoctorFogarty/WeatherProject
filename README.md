# WeatherProject
WeatherProject

This project contains two VS Solutions. WeatherWeb and WeatherWebDB.

The DB project contains the SQL definitions for the Tables, Stored Procedures, and a Post-Deployment script with sample data.

The Main WeatherWeb project contains the .NET MVC web application that displays the static weather data based on the set of ZipCodes in the databse.

Running the DB project will spin up the local DB instance required to run the WeatherWeb project.
